# NFC-Based Attendance System using Java, JDBC, and ESP32

This project is a smart login/logout time tracker using an **ESP32 + NFC reader** and a **Java Swing GUI**. It scans NFC cards to record attendance, logging users in at the first scan and logging them out at the second scan of the same day. All records are stored in a MySQL database and displayed via a desktop application.
